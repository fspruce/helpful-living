## Design

### Colour Scheme

![color palette for the site](/documentation/images/helpful-living-colour-palette.png)

The colour scheme for this site was derived from the logo colors using the [coolers](https://coolors.co/image-picker) web application.

### Typography

Fonts chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Logo Font: Quicksand
- Heading Font: Poppins
- Primary Font: Lato

Since the website is designed for helping primarily older users, and those that need a bit of extra support and care, readability is key. I have chosen fonts which are accessible for the users, while remaining visually modern and pleasing.

The Lato font provides a high level of clarity so that characters are not easily confused (e.g. 1, I and l).

The Poppins font offers a good level of differentiation between characters too, whilst also having a more circular design and stronger weights, allowing it to be useful for my headings.

The Quicksand font has a more gentle curved design, which is visually more inviting for a logo text.

### Imagery

The imagery used throughout the site is indicative of the Helpful Living goal to help those who need it throughout their day-to-day lives. It includes a wide range of diverse individuals, of various ages, to show that anyone can take advantage of the services on offer. The main audience for the business, however, is older individuals who struggle on their own, and so the hero image on the landing page is geared towards them, being a younger woman and an older woman having a a chat and a laugh with each other.

### Entity Relationship Diagram
![Entity relationship diagram showing how each table within the database is linked.](/documentation/images/helpful_living_erd.png)

- **Note**: This was the original plan for my tables. However, as I added more to the site, a couple of the tables did need adjusting (e.g. the booking_time field needed to be split up to an earliest_time and a latest_time for the user to give a time range of availability).

### Wireframes

![Wireframe designs for the site.](/documentation/images/Wirefreames.png)
- Early wireframe designs for the site, showing a basic idea of what the navbar/footer should look like on desktop and mobile, as well as the booking form and the services lists, the two main features to the site.

## Features

### Main Features
- Dynamic list of services:
  - A dedicated paginated services page with a rows of cards showing brief detail as to what each service offers.
  - The user can then click to see more detail on a service, or book from the card itself.
  - Booking from either the card or the detailed service view will automatically fill in what service the user is wanting to discuss, with the option to change this if they wish.
- Custom booking form for the user to fill out in order to book their initial needs meeting with the business:
  - This includes being able to book as a guest (through the use of an automatically generated secure access key), as well as pairing the booking with an account if the user is logged in.
  - The booking form uses JavaScript to allow the user to move back and forth between the booking information and their personal information without the data being lost.
  - An authenticated user will have their name and email filled in automatically from the data they submitted when signing up.
  - Custom validation to ensure the user can only book within the business opening hours, as well as ensuring the owner gets at least a days notice on bookings. The time range the user inputs must also be from an earlier time to a later time (to prevent a range of 1200 - 0930, for example), as well as having at least an hour availabilty within the range (to prevent users saying they're only available between 0920-0940 as this is a pretty specific time slot that may not be available).
- View booking information:
  - User can view their booking information after creating the booking, either by being logged in, by using their access code.
  - If a user creates a guest booking under an email and then creates an account after the fact, the booking info page will pick up on this and link the booking to their account. Currently, this means anyone with a guests email can change their booking, but in future I would have this locked behind email verification.
- Custom admin tools to allow the site owner to add details easier:
  - Since the site was built with an owner in mind, and this owner has less computer ability than myself, I have included a few nicities to the django admin panel.
  - This includes autofill and autocreation of categories for many-to-one fields (e.g. the services the user has in their booking information needs to be linked to an actual service available, and so this field allows the superuser to autofill the services from this menu, or autocreate new services if not available).
  - When logged in as a superuser, the user can also access the django admin panel from the navbar.
- Custom contact form which allows the user to leave a message for the site owner.
- Custom error page which informs the user of the current error, with links to contact the site, return to the previous page, view services or return to the home page.

### General features on each page

- Navbar with logo and nav links. Static to the top of the screen to allow user to access regardless of where they scroll to.
- Welcome message underneath navbar, either generic welcome message for guests, or personalised for authenticated users.
- Footer includes a small copyright message, as well as a button to bring up a contact form.
- Pages make use of font awesome icons to help guide the user to the correct locations.

### Responsivity

</details>

#### Booking Info
- The "Am I Responsive" site would not allow for me to show the booking info page due to an error with csrf tokens. As such, here are some images to show the main features of the booking info page:

<details>
  <summary><b>View</b><hr/></summary>
  <img alt="Image to show the booking info page" src="documentation/images/responsive-testing/booking_info.png">
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Edit</b><hr/></summary>
  <img alt="Image to show the booking info edit form" src="documentation/images/responsive-testing/booking_edit.png">
  <img alt="Image to show the booking info page after edit" src="documentation/images/responsive-testing/booking_edit_2.png">
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Cancel</b><hr/></summary>
  <img alt="Image to show responsivity of the booking page without the log in prompt" src="documentation/images/responsive-testing/booking_cancel.png">
</details>

### Future Implementations

- I would like each detailed service page to have a section at the bottom which allows the user to rate the service. The star rating would add to the overall star rating straight away, but any comments left would need to be moderated by the site owner.
- I would also like to implement email functionality within the site. This is something I have played around with in my own spare time, and am confident that I would be able to implement it well (email verification for sign up and for colleting bookings, as well as sending the access key to the user through their email), but I did not have enough time.
- A gallery was planned where the site owner could upload images to the page, so that the users would be able to see what the services look like in action.
- A notifications system was planned so users did not have to rely on their emails to recieve updates, as well as letting the site owner manage all updates directly from the site.

## Bugs

|Bug | Fix|
|----|----|
|Missing Procfile for Heroku deployment | Add Procfile to tell Heroku to use Gunicorn to run the app |
|Missing URL for Summernote| Add URL for Summernote|
|Crispy forms implementation broken login/signup buttons| Use form helpers to properly render the form |
|Issues with psycopg2 when moving development from windows machine to linux|Install psycopg2-binary and correct admin settings implemented before installing|
|Spacing between the body and navbar too small, except on service_detail.html which had a styled masthead| Include a wrapper block in base.html which causes the body of html pages to use a content-wrapper class to fix the issue by default, with the option to remove the class if needed|
|Booking form view passing incorrect service information to be used when seeing if the user has chosen to book from specific service in services page|Create separate views for whether a service has been pre-chosen or not to allow for correct information to be passed through at the right time|
|Spacing between time select dropdowns caused them to be on separate rows instead of one single row| Adjust margins until the layout looked correct|
|24 hour time incorrectly formatted in the dropdowns| Use if statements to adjust the innertext of the select options|
|Adding welcome message to navbar broke the service detail page layout| Created a separate "content-wrapper" style class to use with the service_detail pages|
|Site responsiveness not working correctly on larger screens| Change margin sizes until pages looked correct|
|Authenticated users that aren't superusers see a different booking form to other users| View didn't account for authenticated users to have made a booking prior to signing up, so this was edited in the view.|
|Tablet responsiveness had many errors|Tested site on tablet size and fixed stylings for the elements that were incorrect.|
|Within firefox inspect, the calendar feature does not work. Changing the browser size however allows the responsiveness to show on different screen sizes, and the calendar to remain working|Unknown fix currently|
|If a user creates a booking as a guest, then an account after, the bookings page does not link the user to the pre-made booking, but also refuses to let them create another booking due to validation of one booking per email|Compare user email with client email, and connect to the relevent booking.|

## Testing

### Lighthouse
Overall, I am happy with these lighthouse results. The main issue for performance are the images loading up, and the only issue contributing to the best practices score seem to be not manually using HTTPS. This is something I have not yet encountered throughout my bootcamp course, and so will need looking into further.

### Code Validation
#### HTML
Validated using [W3.org Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). Some errors show up, but upon further checking of the HTML both in the IDE and through Google Dev Tools, this seems to be an error formed from dynamically creating content.
